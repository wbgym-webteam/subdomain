# TdW - Module

This module is for an event called "Tag der Wissenschaften" (Day of Science) at the Weinberg Secondary School.

## Structure

The Login is happening at `auth.py`, where you can choose to login either to the TdW or the [SmS](sms.md) Module. When the students logged in successfully, they will be redirected to `/tdw`. 
This is where the presentation selection process happens.
